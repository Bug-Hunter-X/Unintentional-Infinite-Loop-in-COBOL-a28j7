This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs: unintentional infinite loops. The `bug.cob` file contains a COBOL program that is supposed to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.  However, due to a potential error in the loop's termination condition, it might enter into an infinite loop. The `bugSolution.cob` file provides the corrected version of the program.
